###Specification:

* Add event listeners for mouseover and mouseexit to change the opacity of the next and previous buttons.
* Implement the toLeft and toRight functions that will move the margin to display either the next or previous image.
##### Bonus
* Get the animation working so that the images slide across rather than just appearing
