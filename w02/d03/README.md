# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

He answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
He answers 'Whatever.' if you tell him something.
He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).
He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

Write Bob so that you can have an interactive conversation with him.

## Hints

create a class Bob and add a method named chat

here is how we can use it:

```
bob = Bob.new

bob.chat 'Want to go to the movies?'
bob.chat 'God this weather is awful.'

```

## Extensions

### l33t sP34k

Bob, inspired by the 90s, is bringing back "l33t sP34k", and he'll teach you how to do it. Start any sentence with "Bro, ", and he'll translate the rest of it into l33t sP34k for you.

In brief:

* Several vowels are always replaced with numbers: a = 4, e = 3, i = 1, o = 0
* Words that start with a consonant start with lower case
* Consonants after the first letter alternate upper and lower case, except the alternation starts over with lowercase after a digit (ex: sCh00l)
